jamtard
=======
This is an example app on how to do a quick screen capture on OS X. You can capture either the whole Desktop or just one window.

The project is named jamtard as it started out as a bot for playing jam legend - but since jam legend closed it's doors I decided to release this as a sample on screen capturing. The capturing itself is very performant and you can easily capture more than 25 frames per second. The only cpu-hungry operation is drawing the captured NSImage to a custom view.

But no one says you have to draw the image ... maybe hook it up to OpenCV and write an online poker bot? :]
