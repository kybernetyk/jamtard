Planned as a bot for jamlegend.com ... well jam legend shut down :[

So now it's just a skeleton project that implements fast screen/window capturing (50fps without any problems) under OS X. One could hook it up to some image recognition algorithm to have fun with ... say ... poker rooms or something. ;)
